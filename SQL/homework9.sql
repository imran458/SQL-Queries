/*1. What is the pending balance in all non-business customersâ€™ checking accounts? */

This query was initially simple however I found the subquery portion quite challenging.
I selected the pending balance from the bank account and specified checking, however I found it 
difficult to get all non-business customers. From the solution, I understood that I could use an and operator
to specify the customer id who were not in bank.business. I had forgotten that cust_id also belonged to
non-business individuals

/*
For this query, I once again had problems with the subqery portion. I connected the vendor table with 
the vendor address table using the vendor id. This is because the vendor address contains the state. I also was able to 
specify the province via a simple where condition. I had to refer to the solution in order to grasp the subquery.
It makes sense now as I use an or to specify the vendors whose product_cd is greater than 1.

I had a lot of issues with this query. I directly referred to the solution in order to answer this.
I see that in the solution, tmp is an alias for all the available balances created. That alias is used 
to obtain the name and minimum balance. The first select does the first half of the question: it obtains
the minimum balance in all accounts for each customer and the next query joins that for the overall for all 
customers.
